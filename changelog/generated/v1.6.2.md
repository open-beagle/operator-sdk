## v1.6.2

**Note**
This is a security release, wherein base images have been patched. It is recommended that you bump your projectâ€™s base image from a previous `v1.6` patch tag to `v1.6.2`.

### Bug Fixes

- For Ansible- and Helm-based operators, add the `--config` flag, which was mistakenly not added to either ansible-/helm-operator binary when file support was originally added. ([#4780](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/4780))
